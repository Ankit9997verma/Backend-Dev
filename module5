# Branch kya hota hai:
# Branch ek separate line of development hoti hai
# Main branch stable hota hai, features alag branch me

# 1. VIEW BRANCHES


# Show local branches

# Show all branches (local + remote)
git branch -a


# 2. CREATE BRANCH


# Create a new branch
git branch feature


# 3. SWITCH BRANCH


# Switch to branch (old way)
git checkout feature

# Switch to branch (new way)
git switch feature


# 4. CREATE & SWITCH TO BRANCH


git checkout -b new-feature
git switch -c new-feature


# 5. MERGE BRANCH


# Switch to main branch
git switch main

# Merge feature branch into main
git merge feature

# Abort merge if conflict happens
git merge --abort


# 6. TYPES OF MERGES


# Fast-forward merge:
# When main branch has no new commits

# Three-way merge:
# When both branches have new commits
# Creates a merge commit

# 7. DELETE BRANCH


# Safe delete (merged branch only)
git branch -d feature

# Force delete
git branch -D feature


# 8. RENAME BRANCH
