// //1. Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous File Operations

// Synchronous File Operations

// Block the execution

// yes

// Perfect 👍
// Here is the complete answer written in a proper, clean, and formal manner, suitable for exams, assignments, and viva.

// 1. Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous File Operations

// Synchronous File Operations:

// Execute one operation at a time.

// Block the execution of the program until the file operation is completed.

// The next line of code runs only after completion.

// Suitable for small scripts or startup tasks.

// Asynchronous File Operations:

// Non-blocking in nature.

// File operations run in the background.

// Program continues execution without waiting.

// Preferred in Node.js for better performance.

// 2. When Should You Use File Streams Instead of Reading the Entire File?

// File streams should be used when:

// The file size is very large.

// Memory usage needs to be minimized.

// Data must be processed in parts (chunks).

// Performing file transfers such as uploads, downloads, or copying files.

// Streams are more efficient than reading the entire file into memory.

// 3. Purpose of the utf8 Encoding Parameter in File Operations

// The utf8 encoding parameter:

// Converts binary data into human-readable text.

// Ensures correct interpretation of characters.

// Prevents returning data in raw buffer format.

// Using utf8 allows text files to be read and written correctly.

// 4. Common Error Codes in File System Operations

// Some commonly encountered file system error codes are:

// ENOENT – File or directory does not exist.

// EACCES – Permission denied.

// EISDIR – Operation expected a file but found a directory.

// ENOTDIR – Operation expected a directory but found a file.

// EEXIST – File or directory already exists.

// EMFILE – Too many open files.

// These error codes help in identifying and handling specific file system issues.

// 5. How to Safely Delete a Directory with All Its Contents

// A directory can be safely deleted along with all its contents using recursive deletion.

// Recursive deletion removes all files and subdirectories.

// Force deletion ignores errors if the directory does not exist.

// This method should be used cautiously as deletion is permanent.

// 6. Concept of Piping in Streams

// Piping is a mechanism that connects the output of one stream to the input of another.

// It transfers data automatically in chunks.

// Improves performance and reduces memory usage.

// Example:
// Copying data from one file to another using streams.

// 7. Importance of Handling Errors in File Operations

// Handling errors is important because:

// Files may not exist or may be inaccessible.

// Permission issues can occur.

// Disk failures or memory issues may arise.

// Prevents application crashes.

// Proper error handling ensures application stability and reliability.

// 8. Difference between writeFile and appendFile Methods

// writeFile Method:

// Writes data to a file.

// Overwrites existing content.

// appendFile Method:

// Adds data to the end of an existing file.

// Preserves previous content.

// Both methods are used for writing data but differ in how they handle existing content.
